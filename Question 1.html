<h1>Question 1</h1>
<p>You have a JavaScript array containing team names and scores:</p>
<code>[{"teamName":"The green team", "score":9},"teamName":"The red team","score":4},
{"teamName":"The gold team","score":10},{"teamName":"The blue team","score":9} etc...]</code>
<p>(Assume all team names are different and all scores are whole numbers. They are not ordered.)</p>
<p>Write some code (JavaScript or pseudocode is fine) that displays the data in text form in a basic leaderboard with equals signs where appropriate for equal scores.</p>
<div id="ans"></div>
<p>Please open this in an editor, to see the code.</p>
<script>
//Object
var teamScores = [{teamName:"The green team", score:9},
				  				{teamName:"The red team", score:4},
                  {teamName:"The gold team", score:10},
                  {teamName:"The blue team", score:9},
                  {teamName:"The yellow team", score:3}
];

//convert and sort the array
var byScore = teamScores.slice(0);
byScore.sort(function(a,b) {
    return b.score - a.score;
});

//Get the length of the array
var len = byScore.length;
//Set default values
var text = "";
var j = 0;
//Loop through the array and get the current and previous scores
for(i=0; i < len; i++){
	var current = byScore[i]["score"];
	var previous = byScore[(i+len-1)%len]["score"];
	//var next = byScore[(i+1)%len]["score"];

//Check the current and previous and set values to determine place
	if(current == previous) {
		//text = "";
		text = "=";
		j = j - 1;
	}
	else
	{
		text = "";
	}
//Add place text
    switch(j) {
 		case 0:
 			text += "1st place: ";
        	break;
 		case 1:
 			text += "2nd place: ";
        	break;
 		case 2:
 			text += "3rd place: ";
        	break;
 		default:
 			text += "unranked: ";
        	break;
    }
//String text together and add it to the div
	document.getElementById("ans").innerHTML += "<p>" + text + byScore[i]["teamName"] + "</p> ";
	j = j + 1;
}
